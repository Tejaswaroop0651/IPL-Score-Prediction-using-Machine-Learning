# IPL-Score-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project uses machine learning to predict the final score of a cricket team in an IPL match based on in-game factors. The model aims to assist fans, analysts, and enthusiasts by providing real-time score predictions during matches.

-> **Input Features:** The model takes several game parameters as input, such as:
    ● Current batting team and bowling team 
    ● Runs scored so far, wickets lost, and overs completed
    ● Runs and wickets in the last 5 overs, which reflect recent momentum
-> **Model:** The prediction model is based on a Random Forest Regressor, known for its robustness in handling tabular data and its ability to capture non-linear relationships 
   between input features.

-> **Output**: The model predicts the final score the batting team is likely to achieve by the end of their innings. This output helps users gauge the expected performance 
   based on the current match situation.

● **Usage:** With ongoing match data, the model continuously updates the expected score, providing more accurate estimates as the innings progresses.

● **Future Scope:** This model could be further enhanced by adding more contextual features, such as player stats, pitch conditions, and weather information.

**This project demonstrates how machine learning can enhance sports analytics and provide predictive insights during live games.**
